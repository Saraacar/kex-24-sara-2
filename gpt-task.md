# Galaxy Pets: Collect and Train Your Cosmic Companions

For this programming assignment in Java, you are stepping into the shoes of a cosmic trainer, embarking on a journey through the universe to collect and train Galaxy Pets. These are mythical creatures with unique abilities and attributes that you'll be modeling in Java.

## Deadline
This assignment is due before the next scheduled class.

## Instructions
For instructions on how to complete and submit this assignment, please refer to the assignments section of the course instructions reachable via [assignments section of our course webpage](https://assignments.example.com).

## Preparation

- Complete and understand all questions in Module 2: "Exploring Object-Oriented Programming".
- Access the OLI material through Canvas or directly via [programming course materials](https://programmingmaterials.example.com).

Note: The OLI material and tasks this year may not perfectly align, so it's okay to read ahead if you did not find everything mentioned.

## Learning Goals

The goals for this week include understanding how to:
- Design Java classes.
- Implement fields and methods within a class.
- Utilize the `main` method for testing.
- Understand the concept of object encapsulation.
- Manage object interaction within a Java application.

## Assignment Details

Your journey through the galactic frontier begins with the creation of unique Galaxy Pets crafted from the essence of cosmic phenomena. Dive into this universe by modeling these creatures in Java. Let your imagination run wild; perhaps a Starlion with the roar of a collapsing star, or a Nebulupi, a wolf made from the gas of a nebulous cloud.

### Task 1: Class Creation

Start by creating a file named `GalaxyPet.java` inside the `src` directory. Declare the GalaxyPet class within this file.

### Task 2: Defining Properties

Our Galaxy Pets need characteristics. Define the following fields within the GalaxyPet class, without assigning any initial values:

- String name
- int energyLevel
- int cosmicPower
- int speed
- boolean asleep

### Task 3: Spawning Galaxy Pets

In the `main` method of your GalaxyPet class, create and instantiate a "Starlion" with initial values for its characteristics. Use the dot operator to set these attributes directly for now.

### Task 4: Encapsulation with Getters and Setters

To encapsulate the inner workings of our Galaxy Pets, change the access modifiers of your fields to `private`. Then, implement getters and setters for each property.

### Task 5: Constructing with Constructors

Implement a constructor for the GalaxyPet class that allows setting all characteristics upon instantiation. Create a second pet, "Nebulupi", using this constructor.

### Task 6: Display Information

Create a method named `displayInfo` within the GalaxyPet class that prints out all information about the pet to the console.

### Task 7: The Cosmic Challenge

Galaxy Pets can challenge each other to cosmic duels. Implement a method named `challenge` where one pet can challenge another. The outcome will determine which pet gains cosmic power. Incorporate simple logic based on your chosen attributes.

### Task 8: Understanding Scope and Shadowing

Review examples of scope and variable shadowing provided in the reading materials. Be prepared to adjust your implementation if necessary, focusing on proper usage of the `this` keyword.

## Final Checklist

- [ ] Created and developed the GalaxyPet class with fields and methods.
- [ ] Utilized getters and setters for encapsulation.
- [ ] Implemented constructors for easy object instantiation.
- [ ] Developed a method displaying a pet's info.
- [ ] Enabled Galaxy Pets to challenge each other.
