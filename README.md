# Programming Task: The Magical Library

Welcome to the second exercise of this programming course! In this task, you will delve into the world of magical libraries and practice modeling objects in Java.

### Deadline
Complete this task before the specified due date.

### Instructions
Follow the instructions carefully, and if you encounter any issues, feel free to seek assistance.

### Preparation
Read and answer all questions in the relevant module about modeling classes in Java.

### Learning Goals
- Designing Java classes
- Adding instance fields
- Creating constructors
- Implementing getter and setter methods
- Using the dot operator to access object fields
- Implementing a simple method in a class

### Troubleshooting Guide
If you have any questions or face difficulties, follow these steps:
1. Check for posted issues in the course materials.
2. If your question is not addressed, create a new issue with a clear title.
3. Seek help from the course teaching assistants during the designated lab hours.

### Assignment

In the enchanting realm of magical libraries, there exist mystical tomes that hold arcane knowledge. Your task is to model these magical tomes in Java!

### Task 1: Creating a Tome Class

1. Create a new Java file named `Tome.java` in the designated folder.
2. Define a class named `Tome` within the file.
3. Add the following instance fields to the `Tome` class:
   - `String title`
   - `int pages`
   - `String author`
   - `boolean borrowed`
4. Implement a constructor for the `Tome` class that initializes the fields.
5. Create setter and getter methods for each field in the `Tome` class.

### Task 2: Using the Tome Class

1. Instantiate three magical tomes objects using the `Tome` class constructor with different values.
2. Print out the information of each tome using the getter methods.
3. Implement a method in the `Tome` class named `displayInfo()` that prints out all relevant information about the tome.

### Task 3: Library Interactions

1. Implement a method in the `Tome` class called `borrowTome()` that changes the `borrowed` status to true.
2. Implement a method in the `Tome` class named `returnTome()` that sets the `borrowed` status back to false.
3. Create instances of tomes and simulate borrowing and returning actions by invoking these methods.

### Task 4: Variable Shadowing

Study the examples provided regarding variable shadowing in Java. Be prepared to explain a fix for variable shadowing during class discussions.

### Checklist
- [ ] Define the `Tome` class with instance fields.
- [ ] Implement a constructor and setter/getter methods in the `Tome` class.
- [ ] Instantiate three tomes objects, display their information, and use the `displayInfo()` method.
- [ ] Implement the `borrowTome()` and `returnTome()` methods in the `Tome` class.
- [ ] Study the variable shadowing examples.
