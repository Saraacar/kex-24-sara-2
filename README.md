## Customized Task for Programming Practice

### Task Description
In a magical forest called "Code Woods," there are mythical creatures known as "Codebeasts." Your task is to model these Codebeasts in Java using classes and objects. 

#### Task Steps:
- Create a Java class called `Codebeast` in the `src` folder.
- Define the following fields for the `Codebeast` class:
  - `String name`
  - `int level`
  - `int healthPoints`
  - `int attackPower`
  - `boolean isDefeated`
- Implement a constructor in the `Codebeast` class that takes all the fields as arguments and initializes them.
- Implement getter and setter methods for all the fields in the `Codebeast` class.
- Create three instances of the `Codebeast` class using the constructor.
- Print information about each Codebeast using a method called `displayInfo()` that prints all the details of the Codebeast.
- Implement an `attack()` method in the `Codebeast` class that takes another `Codebeast` as a parameter and simulates an attack. The attack should decrease the opponent's health points and eventually mark them as defeated (if their health points reach 0).

### Task Checklist
- [ ] Create the `Codebeast` class with the specified fields.
- [ ] Implement the constructor and getter/setter methods for the `Codebeast` class.
- [ ] Create instances of the `Codebeast` class using the constructor.
- [ ] Implement the `displayInfo()` method to print all details of a Codebeast.
- [ ] Implement the `attack()` method to simulate attacks between Codebeasts.

### Submitting the Task
Once you have completed all the steps, ensure that your code compiles without any errors. Submit your Java file containing the `Codebeast` class along with a brief explanation of your implementation.
