# Lorem Ipsum Task

For the second exercise of Lorem Ipsum programming, you are going to practice modeling objects in Java. You are going to acquaint yourself with the components of a Java class.

### Deadline
This work should be completed before the exercise, on **Friday 15th September**.

### Instructions
For instructions on how to do and submit the assignment, please see the
[assignments section of the course instructions](https://loremipsum.com/assignments).

### Preparation

- Read and answer all questions in Module 2: [Looking Inside Classes](https://loremipsum.com/module2)
- Access the OLI material both via the platform or directly at this [webpage](https://loremipsum.com/programming)

### Learning Goals

This week's learning goals include:
* Designing Java classes
* Adding instance fields
* Adding a constructor method
* Creating *getters* and *setters*
* Using the dot operator
* Printing to the terminal
* Using the `main` method
* Scope (or *variable shadowing*)

### Troubleshooting Guide
If you have any questions or problems, follow this procedure: 

1. Look at this week's posted issues. Are other students asking about your problem?
2. If not, post a question yourself by creating a new issue. Add a descriptive title, beginning with "Task x: *summary of problem here*"
3. Ask a TA in person during the weekly lab. Check your schedule to see when the next lab is.

We encourage you to discuss with your course friends, but **do not share answers**!

### Assignment

In the land of Lorem Ipsum, there exists a mythical creature called *Loremipsumon*. Your task at hand is to model these mythical creatures in Java! Here is a visualization to inspire your imagination:

```

Next, let's move on to creating *Loremipsumon* objects in Java.

#### Exercise 2.0 - Getting Started

Create a new Java file called `Loremipsumon.java` in the `src` folder. Define the class `Loremipsumon` within it. Add a main method and delve into creating your very first Loremipsumon object. 

In the main method, create variables for the following attributes of a Loremipsumon: 
- `String` name 
- `int` healthPoints (HP) 
- `int` power 
- `int` defense 
- `boolean` fainted 

#### Exercise 2.1 - More Creatures

Expand your knowledge by creating two more Loremipsumon objects using the same approach as in Exercise 2.0. 

#### Exercise 2.2 - Fields

Implement fields for the Loremipsumon class with the attributes mentioned in Exercise 2.0. Test modifying their values directly using the dot operator on a Loremipsumon object.

#### Exercise 2.3 - Getters and Setters

Create getter and setter methods for all fields in the Loremipsumon class. Use these methods to access and modify the values of the Loremipsumon objects.

#### Exercise 2.4 - Constructor

Introduce a constructor method for the Loremipsumon class. Create a few Loremipsumon objects using the constructor. Use the constructor method to set initial values for the Loremipsumon attributes.

#### Exercise 2.5 - Printing Info

Implement a method called `printInfo()` in the Loremipsumon class to display all information about a Loremipsumon object in a structured manner.

#### Exercise 2.6 - Friendly Interaction

Add a method called `interact()` in the Loremipsumon class to simulate a friendly interaction between Loremipsumons. Print the interaction messages to the console.

#### Exercise 2.7 - Exploring Encapsulation

Dig deeper into encapsulation by setting appropriate access modifiers for the fields of the Loremipsumon class. Modify the methods and variables to adhere to encapsulation principles.

### Checklist 
- [ ] Create three Loremipsumon objects directly in the main method and print their information to the console.
- [ ] Define and use fields for the Loremipsumon class to store information about each creature.
- [ ] Implement getters and setters for each field to access and modify the Loremipsumon attributes.
- [ ] Create a constructor method for the Loremipsumon class and use it to initialize multiple objects.
- [ ] Develop a `printInfo()` method to display all information of a Loremipsumon object.
- [ ] Create an `interact()` method for friendly interactions between Loremipsumons.
- [ ] Apply encapsulation principles with appropriate access modifiers for the class fields and methods.
