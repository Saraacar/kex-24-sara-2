# Welcome to the Farmyard Challenge!

In this exercise, you will dive into the world of farm animals and create a Java class to model various creatures that reside on a farm.

### Deadline
Please complete this task before the upcoming exercise on **Monday, 3rd of November**.

### Instructions
For detailed instructions on how to complete and submit the assignment, refer to the course website.

### Preparation
Make sure to review the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming and class design before attempting this task. You can explore the relevant OLI material or official Java documentation to refresh your knowledge.


### Task Description

In the fertile lands of our farm, we have various animals that roam around. Your task is to create a Java class to model these farm animals. To get started, create a new Java file called `FarmAnimal.java` in the `src` folder.

### Exercise 1: Define the FarmAnimal Class
Define a class called `FarmAnimal` with the following instance fields:
- `String name` to store the name of the animal
- `int age` to store the age of the animal
- `String sound` to store the sound the animal makes

Implement a constructor for the class that takes the name, age, and sound as parameters and initializes the instance fields.

### Exercise 2: Create Farm Animals
In your `main` method, create instances of different farm animals such as cows, chickens, and pigs using the constructor you implemented in Exercise 1. Assign appropriate values to the `name`, `age`, and `sound` fields of each animal.

### Exercise 3: Print Animal Information
Implement a method called `printInfo()` within the `FarmAnimal` class. This method should print out the information about the animal, including its name, age, and the sound it makes.

### Exercise 4: Interact with the Animals
In your `main` method, call the `printInfo()` method for each farm animal you created to display their information to the console.

### Bonus Exercise:
Challenge yourself by adding additional methods to the `FarmAnimal` class, such as `feed()`, `makeSound()`, or `checkHealth()`, and implement functionality for those methods.

### Final Checklist
- Define and implement the `FarmAnimal` class with instance fields and a constructor.
- Create instances of farm animals in the `main` method and assign values to their fields.
- Implement the `printInfo()` method to display the animal information.
- Interact with the animals by calling the `printInfo()` method in the `main` method.

### Acknowledgment
This custom task was created for you with the farm animal theme by your dedicated Java teacher. Good luck with the farmyard challenge!
